Effective Java Distributed Application Development
==================================================

I am a Java system architect and software developer who
leads the implementation of projects within the big data
ecosystem. This book documents aspects of application design
which are in many ways matters of opinion, but about which
I have developed very strong opinions. Despite the fact
that this book is oriented toward a particular development
practice, I hope you may find it useful or inspiring for
other languages or domains.

I decided to write this book after I found myself frequently
repeating explanations to code reviews. Rather than continually
repeat myself, and engaging in iterative feedback with
developers on my team, I felt it was time to start codifying
some of the explanations so that I could provide a detailed
baseline for them to read and explore prior to a more
in-depth conversation.

As I continue to encounter new questions, I will continue to
update this reference. Please watch on Github.
